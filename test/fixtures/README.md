# Fixtures

Eleven blank published forms, byte for byte but for a person's name or ID blanked in two, and one sample that `scripts/make-acroform-fixture.js` writes.

Locked means AES-128 under the empty user password. Fields are counted as the inventory counts them: each radio button is one, and a field painted in two places is one.

## Add one

1. Put the file here unchanged, with nothing a person entered. A name or ID of its author or contact is blanked, and its entry says so and keeps the published file's hash.
2. Add its entry to `MANIFEST.json`, with its URL and the date checked ([#53](https://github.com/tonguetoquill/quillify/issues/53)).
3. Add its row above, and for a published form its inventory to [`../goldens/`](../goldens).

`test/fixtures.test.ts` holds each file to its hash, and `test/canon.test.ts` each row to the manifest and the golden. A hostile input is no fixture: its test builds it.
